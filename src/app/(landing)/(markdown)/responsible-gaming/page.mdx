# Responsible Gaming

## Commitment to Responsible Gaming

At Tournaments.com, we are dedicated to promoting a safe and enjoyable gaming environment. We believe in the importance of responsible gaming and are committed to providing resources and support to help players game safely.

## Self-Assessment Tools

We encourage our players to regularly evaluate their gaming habits. To assist with this, we offer self-assessment tools that help you reflect on your gaming behavior. These tools can help you identify whether your gaming is within healthy limits.

## Setting Limits and Self-Exclusion

To ensure a balanced gaming experience, we provide options to set personal limits on your gaming activities, including:

- **Deposit Limits**: Control how much you spend on entries or in-game purchases.
- **Time Limits**: Set daily or weekly limits on how much time you spend gaming.
- **Self-Exclusion**: If you feel the need to take a break, you can choose to temporarily suspend your account. During this period, you will not be able to access your account or participate in tournaments.

## Underage Gaming Prevention

We take underage gaming very seriously. To prevent minors from participating, we implement strict age verification measures during account registration. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise their childrenâ€™s gaming activities.

## Support Resources

If you or someone you know is experiencing gaming-related issues, we recommend reaching out to professional support services. Several organizations specialize in helping individuals manage gaming addiction and provide counseling resources.

## Parental Controls

To help parents manage their children's gaming experiences, we provide a range of parental controls. These tools allow parents to monitor gameplay, set time limits, and restrict access to certain features. We encourage parents to engage in conversations with their children about responsible gaming habits.
